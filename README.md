# tebako-runtime-node

Node.js (official prebuilt distributions) as a tebako **runtime** — the
hermetic `node` engine: the release ships the pair per platform, the
tebako-owned wrapper exe (`tebako-runtime-launcher`, the process entry
point) plus the env image (`.tfs`, mounted — never extracted).

- **kind:** runtime (`engine: node`, `implementation: node`)
- **upstream:** Node.js 24.21.0 (LTS Krypton) from nodejs.org, repacked —
  no compilation. The linux-musl legs come from
  unofficial-builds.nodejs.org (the docker-node provenance; nodejs.org
  ships no musl build) and carry that origin in their manifest's
  provenance keys — resolution picks them by triplet, never by selector.
- **artifacts:** `tebako-runtime-<tebako-line>-<implementation>-<version>-<platform>[.exe]`
  + `.tfs` + `.sha256` sidecars + `<stem>.manifest.json` release shards
  (+ a detached `.asc` per served name on signing-enabled lines), and
  this registry (`tpkg-registry.yaml`) on the repo's default branch
- **visibility:** the locked default order — preload on POSIX (node is a
  dynamic interpreter, with the link-unit preload shim granted), the
  exec cache on windows (the payload root is declared `home`, so the
  whole tree materializes there)

The artifact name carries the distribution segment
([tebako#716](https://github.com/tamatebako/tebako/issues/716)): new
publishes spell
`tebako-runtime-<tebako-line>-<implementation>-<version>-<platform>`,
where `<implementation>` is the flavor's identity (`node` today — the
recipe ships one flavor; a future distribution variant slots its own
segment in through its flavor block). Releases already published keep
the segment-less spelling
(`tebako-runtime-<tebako-line>-<version>-<platform>`) forever: they are
immutable and sha256-pinned in this registry, and re-running an old tag
composes that ref's own names, self-consistently. Tooling that reads
artifact names (the registry mirror, the release gem) accepts both
spellings.

Consumers' app payloads declare
`runtime_requirement: {engine: node, constraint: ">= 24"}` on their
entrypoints; the dispatcher resolves the newest compatible cached
runtime (or downloads + verifies it from this repo's release index).
Payloads with native addons (`.node` binaries) pin the ABI line instead
— `~> 137` on the v24 line (`NODE_MODULE_VERSION`; `~> 127` on v22) —
so a wrong-line resolution is a named error, never a segfault.

> The dispatch surface for a runtime's OWN entries
> (`tebako run node:node`, shimmed `node`) is PLANNED product-side.
> Until it lands the dist tree's commands are declared in the runtime
> manifest's additive entrypoints list (the registry carries no
> entrypoints on kind: runtime) and the interpreter answers the spec 17
> wire directly (`--tebako-entry node …` on the wrapper exe).

Platform coverage follows the tebako launcher's: macOS (arm64, x86_64),
linux (gnu + musl, x86_64 + arm64), windows (x86_64). The
aarch64-windows leg lands when the product ships
`tebako-runtime-launcher` for windows-ucrt-arm64 — upstream's win-arm64
dist has been official since the v20 line, so only the wrapper is missing.

## Release shape

On a tag, each build leg **publishes and signs in-leg**: the leg that
built a pair uploads only the write-once names it owns (the wrapper exe,
the `.tfs` env image, both `.sha256` sidecars, the
`<stem>.manifest.json` shard) and — when `TEBAKO_RELEASE_SIGNING_ENABLED`
is armed — signs every one of those served names itself (no-fold rule:
nothing is ever "covered by" another artifact's signature; the shard
declares each artifact's `{keyid, asc}` block from the
`TEBAKO_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEYID` repo variable). No shared mutable file
exists, so all legs publish concurrently with zero rendezvous.

There is **no monolithic `manifest.json` / `SHA256SUMS.txt` release
asset**: both are derivable conveniences, computed consumer-side from
the shards + the asset listing (`tebako-pkg release-index`). The release
notes are written once at release creation (by whichever leg wins the
create race) and never rewritten. Every asset name is write-once: a
re-run skips digest-matching names and loudly keeps differing ones — a
bad published artifact is remedied by `status: withdrawn` in the
registry plus the next patch line, never by delete-and-replace.

The single `release` job then keeps only the two whole-matrix duties:

1. **Audit** (`tools/audit_release.rb`, read-only) — the expected
   (flavor × platform) matrix, derived from the workflow's own build
   matrix × `Tebakofile`'s pins, must be a subset of the release
   listing; on signing-enabled lines every served name's `.asc` is
   required, and the retired monoliths are refused.
2. **Registry** (`tools/registry_update.rb`) — renders
   `tpkg-registry.yaml` from the release's shards (never from
   templates) and lands it on `main` by bot PR. The merge preserves
   existing versions' rows and any `status: withdrawn` marks;
   `default:` tracks the newest non-withdrawn version.

Tooling specs live in `spec/` and run in the lint workflow. The release
sign pass is the tebako-release gem's (tamatebako/tebako-release-tooling,
pinned at Tebakofile's `tools.release_tooling`) — its coverage lives
with the gem.
